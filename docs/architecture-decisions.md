## ADR-001: Clean Architecture Adoption

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-06-01  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context
We needed to establish a scalable, maintainable architecture for a complex Korean real estate platform with multiple external integrations and complex business rules.

### Decision
Adopt Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture) with distinct layers:
- **Domain Layer**: Business entities and rules
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and business logic orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (database, APIs, frameworks)
- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers and user interface adapters

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic and technical implementation
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test business logic without infrastructure dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations without affecting core business logic
- **Korean Domain Complexity**: Need clear modeling of complex subscription rules
- **External Dependencies**: Multiple government APIs require isolation

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- High testability with isolated business logic
- Easy to understand and maintain code structure
- Flexible integration with external systems
- Clear separation between Korean business rules and technical implementation

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity for simple operations
- More boilerplate code compared to traditional layered architecture
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Clean Architecture

**Neutral:**
- Requires discipline to maintain architectural boundaries

## ADR-002: JWT Authentication with Database Storage

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-06-02  
**Deciders**: Security Team, Backend Team

### Context
Need secure authentication system supporting both web and mobile clients, with ability to revoke tokens and track user sessions.

### Decision
Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with database storage:
- **Access Tokens**: 60-minute lifespan, HS256 algorithm
- **Refresh Tokens**: 24-hour lifespan
- **Database Storage**: Store tokens in `user_token` table
- **Blacklisting**: Support token revocation via blacklist flag

### Rationale
- **Stateless Authentication**: JWT tokens contain user information
- **Security**: Database storage enables token revocation and blacklisting
- **Scalability**: Can distribute across multiple server instances
- **Mobile Support**: Tokens work well with mobile applications
- **Korean Government APIs**: Many require secure authentication patterns

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Secure token-based authentication
- Ability to revoke tokens for security
- Good performance with stateless verification
- Supports multiple client types

**Negative:**
- Database dependency for token validation
- Slightly more complex than pure stateless JWT
- Token storage requires cleanup of expired entries

**Neutral:**
- Standard industry practice for secure web applications

- Use `SoftDeleteListener` for automated handling
- All queries include `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
- Maintain referential integrity through soft deletes

### Rationale
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Korean data retention requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all operations
- **Data Recovery**: Ability to restore accidentally deleted data
- **Business Intelligence**: Historical analysis capabilities
- **User Trust**: Users can recover their data if needed

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Full audit trail for compliance
- Data recovery capabilities
- Referential integrity maintained
- Historical analysis possible

**Negative:**
